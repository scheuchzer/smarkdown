#Smarkdown
## Naming


Smarkdown automatically creates a sitemap that contains all available
documents. The document names are converted into some human readable
form.


For example a document with the name

```
myFolder/myDoc.md
```

will be listed as

```
My folder/My doc
```


Examples:

- [Folder with space](examples/folder+names/folder_with_space.md)
- [Folder with underscore](examples/folder_names/folder_with_underscore.md)
- [Folder with CamelCase](examples/folderNames/folder_with_camelCase.md)
